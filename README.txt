Interactive Periodic Table

Three python projects created for chemistry.
1. Periodic table with GUI in python Tkinter interface, when pressing on each element it will return its Wikipedia source page.
2. Periodic table with no GUI, when inputing atomic number or atomic symbol of the element, It will simply return some of it's characteristics.
3. Served my applications using Tornado python framework and webserver.
4. Exposed the server with 2 API endpoints to get data about atoms in the periodic table.
5. Tested my projects with Postman, uploaded to GitHub, and hosted them on AWS and Azure.
